# About The Project




In this Project, I've built a Web3 Dapp called Decentralized Ticketing System, using this Decentralized Application one can book tickets for various events and can even aridrop them. All these tickets are available in the form NFTs, and can be made available to OpenSea as well. These NFTs are transferable as well. The maximum number of tickets available are 10,000 and maximum mintable are 5.


Use the `README.md` to get started.
